# Portfolio
This project describes and links to various projects of mine to serve as a simple programming portfolio.

## School Projects
* JShell, a basic fake shell/terminal-like application created for mt Object Oriented Programming class: https://github.com/vgf89/JShell-CSE-213
* An actual Linux shell, programmed in C for a Systems Programming course: https://github.com/vgf89/LinuxShell-CSE222
* The Recipe Stop, a PostgreSQL and Pyramid driven web-application for sharing recipes (site no longer hosted, but repository is here, just ask me for access): https://github.com/vgf89/RecipeStop
* Simulated Star-Of-Stars and Star-In-Ring networks created in C# for a Networking course (can provide on request)

## Personal
* [Chip8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator in Rust (WIP):
https://github.com/vgf89/chip8remu

## Intern projects:
* Parts of an instrument control and logging software for RH Systems. I mostly worked on some UI design/implementation, as well as real-time plotting behaviors
* RHCalc, a meterological calculator Android app developed for RH Systems during a summer internship. Verfying calculations was test driven with JTest. (will provide APK upon request)
* A simple inventory management system for RH Systems, programmed in Python, using the CheryPy framework, Postgres database, and the SQLAlchemy toolkit
