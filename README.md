# Portfolio

This project describes and links to various projects of mine to serve as a simple programming portfolio.

## School Projects

* An Linux shell, programmed in C for a Systems Programming course: https://github.com/vgf89/LinuxShell-CSE222
* The Recipe Stop, a PostgreSQL and Pyramid driven web-application for sharing recipes (site no longer hosted, but code repository is here, just email me for access): https://github.com/vgf89/RecipeStop

## Personal

* [Chip8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator in Rust (WIP):
https://github.com/vgf89/chip8remu

## Intern projects:

* Parts of an instrument control and logging software for RH Systems. I mostly worked on some UI design/implementation, as well as real-time plotting behaviors
* RHCalc, a meterological calculator Android app developed for RH Systems during a summer internship. Verfying calculations was test driven with JTest. (can provide APK upon request)
* A simple inventory management system for RH Systems, programmed in Python using the CheryPy, SQLAlchemy, and a Postgres database
